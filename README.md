This project is my contribution to helping to analyze the probability of a person having the infection. Technologies that were made to convert information so that it can be accessible to computers are used to aid people and I can contribute to a social cause.


COVID 19 Detector is a Web Application Prototype Developed by ME and built for Doctors to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity by finding out the probability of a person having the infection.

In light of the ever-evolving Covid-19 situation, This project also contains an interactive world map of the corona virus that pin-points corona-virus cases around the world.

To aid people by providing them knowledge through a Web Application has not been done yet.

- The Objective is to Stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly
- Data can be collected on the symptoms of COVID-19
- A machine learning model is then trained on the data to find out the probability of a person having the infection
- The model is then used to find out whom to test for the infection first under a limited testing capacity
- The same model can be used to find potential candidates for conducting random tests 

To aid people by providing them knowledge through a Web Application has not been done yet.


## Built With

This Web App is a dashboard developed in Flask (Python), HTML, Bootstrap/CSS and using Machine Learning. World map is created using Mapbox-Map-GL.

## Usage

The project currently a Prototype. Data to be randomly generated for this Prototype. This model uses a technique called Logistic Regression.
An HTML file will contain the UI with a form capable of sorting inferring the input data from the trained model.
